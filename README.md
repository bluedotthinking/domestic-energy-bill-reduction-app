# domestic-energy-bill-reduction-app

Welcome to DEBRA - Domestic Energy Bill Reduction App

This is a basic readme - to be expanded later!

This repo consists of 3 main parts:

1. Underlying data (.json, .csv, .xls files)
2. Simulation Jupyter Notebook 
3. Streamlit Application

To generate new results after updating underlying data, run all cells in the scenario_simulation.ipynb notebook

To run the application locally, enter "streamlit run streamlit_web_app.py" in terminal, within the repo's folder
